##  About Solving for India
GeeksforGeeks is partnering with Google Cloud and AMD to host a Pan-India Hackathon, where 100 colleges from all across India will participate. Students will compete within their Institutes in online hackathons, using Google Cloud to build innovative projects based on a chosen theme. The top 3 teams from each Institute will then move on to showcase their projects at regional level, with the top teams from each region moving on to the national level for the final showcase.
